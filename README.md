# hello-world
This is my first repository.

Hi! Sending my pleasant greetings to the person whom will spare time to read my description in this repository. 

I'm Christian Wayne Pasco, taking the course of Bachelor in Science of Information Technology. A second year student, born at the young age late 2000s located at Southern-West of Cebu.

Loves to sing, dance, write poems, watch hollywood movies, learn new things in programming codes, draw, play music instrument and many to mention. Likes to play online games, surfing social platforms/media, play sports and tickling some mathematical problems and puzzles.

Many people could probably say that I'm a responsible and a hard working student. Moreover, being sociable person. Likes to receive and deal with challenging tasks. In other words, an enthusiastic one. Subsequently, I value life the most and that really matters to me at all.

Appreciating the blessings that God gave me is that creates a perfectly imperfect image as an individual. Leaving a trace of high hopes and glorious faith through prayers would help me to track the right path of my future and meeting new people is the best way to grow and develop my skills, not only for the aspects in having real life but the true essence within it.
I'm a big believer that today's world online programmers must master the art of computer languages and debugging that make a living as a developer demands solid effort and consistent focus.
But with the massive amount of information out these, Developers work alongside marketers, designers, managers, content creators and many others. Hence, putting my life in this field where It is was supposed to be spent. 
That's all.
